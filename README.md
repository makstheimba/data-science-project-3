## Analyzing Revenue from Megaline's Prepaid Plans
As an imaginary data analyst for Megaline, I was tasked with determining which of the company's two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, was bringing in more revenue. The commercial department wanted to adjust the advertising budget accordingly.

## Data Collection
To carry out this analysis, I selected a sample of 500 Megaline clients and collected the following data:

## Demographic information (e.g., who the clients are and where they're from)
Plan type (Surf or Ultimate)
Usage in terms of the number of calls and text messages sent in 2018
Analysis
I conducted a preliminary analysis of the data to understand the behavior of Megaline's clients and determine which prepaid plan was generating more revenue.

## Results
Through my analysis, I was able to provide insights into the revenue generated by each of Megaline's prepaid plans, helping the commercial department make informed decisions about the company's advertising budget.
